# Hi, I'm Hugh 👋

I’ve spent my [career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hb399/) at the intersection of **technology, product, and strategy**. I'm currently Chief of Staff at [Axelera AI](https://www.axelera.ai), a scale-up building the world’s most efficient **AI chips for edge computing**. Before that, I worked as a **product manager** at BCG, building ventures from the ground up and supporting tech companies across the lifecycle - from pre-seed to scale-up.  

Now, I’m combining those experiences to build software that helps **executive teams and investors** cut through noise and make better decisions. I’m starting with **[MarketBrief.ai](https://marketbrief.ai)** — AI-powered intelligence briefings, personalized and delivered in real time.
